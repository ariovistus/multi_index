M signals to N indeces

suppose 1 signal S applied to N indeces
then 1 slot W needs to be declared in node.
W needs to be connected/disconnected to value
W needs to tell each index of an update at node

suppose N signals at 1 index
signals must be unique
if M signals at exactly 1 index, then need 1 slot W, 
 which gets connected to all M signals.

There may be many nodes/values, want to minimize the number of slots that 
get registered to minimize memory consumption. Having 1 slot per index not so 
good?

Given set S of N indeces, M signals with each signal applied to a subset of S,
 if we make 1 slot per index, then we need to register worst case N*M slots per
 node. Requires at most N slot functions to be declared.

 if we make 1 slot per signal, then we need to register M slots per node.
 Requires at most M slot functions to be declared.

 Optimization: suppose signals S1, S2 attached to the same set of indeces, then
  we need only define 1 slot function W, and connect it to both S1, S2.
